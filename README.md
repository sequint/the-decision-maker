# The Decision Maker

An app that helps me to focus on just one of the crazy ideas that I have.  But feel free to use it for any major life decision!

The main goal along with making an awesomely applicable app, is to implement new front end technologies - specifically @react-three and TypeScript.

Also, since this project is not for professional or academic use, I am freely enjoying create my README file however the hell I want. :metal:

## Tech Highlights

- React.js
- @react-three
- TypeScript
- Node.js
